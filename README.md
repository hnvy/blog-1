# blog-1
A repository that is dedicated to my learning experiences and adventures. Skim through the journal to see if there are any possibly beneficial thoughts or ideas.

See the [commit history](https://github.com/hnvy/blog-1/commits/main) for the latest updates. Alternatively, see the [10 most recent changes](https://github.com/hnvy/blog-1/compare/main%5E%5E%5E%5E%5E%5E%5E%5E%5E%5E...main)!

# About me
I began falling in love with computer science since I was 11. When I was 15, I made the decision to use Linux. However, the current nature of my work requires Windows (work files, software which cannot run on any operating system (OS) other than Windows, etc.) meant that I had to stop using Linux. I considered dual-booting, but it would be too complex and extra friction will be added if I wanted to use a Windows virtual machine on Linux.

I'm not a skilled programmer. I took quite a long break from computer science due to a variety of reasons. And although I continued to make small Python programs for fun, they were by no means large or significant.

# Pearls
Due to the unnecessarily sophisticated nature of this 'blog', good bits of knowledge may get lost in all of the filler content. 

I didn't like the idea that all of the potentially useful pieces of information will end up floating around, everywhere, in the deep sea of knowledge, waiting for a person to take a plunge and discover them. Therefore, I have come up with this new plan. I called it "pearls".

Pearls are top-notch pieces of information which I found to be useful. You'll hopefully be one pearl richer when you find one (unless, of course, you already had a better (or the same) pearl stored in your knowledge box).

Please keep in mind that these pearls are meant to serve as a beginner-to-advanced cheat sheet rather than an all-in-one guide. My skills will develop over time, and the content covered will progress from basic to intermediate, and eventually (hopefully) advanced. So, keep an eye out!

Of course, some pearls will be major and useful, and hence it might be worthwhile to devote a longer post to them.

# Note
Please see [this entry](00.%20journal/01.%20logs/journal_1_logs.md#e4-28022022---no-template-no-problem-t) to learn more about why I will probably no longer follow the format below.

## How will this work?
So, every time I want to learn about something new, I will create a folder with the name of the project. This folder will contain two more folders:

* The `logs` folder contains markdown files that will be updated with my new learning points, learning needs, and action plans (see [Template](#template)). The names of the files in `logs` will follow this naming convention: `PROJECT_#_logs.md`. The first file of every `logs` folder (i.e., `PROJECT_1_logs.md`) contains an introduction and some background.
* The `pearls` folder will also contain markdown files with names that correspond to their `logs` counterparts. The naming convention is the same as before (i.e., a `pearls` file for `PROJECT_1_logs.md` will be called `PROJECT_1_pearls.md`).

## Structure
New entries will appear at the top of the file. I will use the following description template to make it easier for you to navigate the [commit history](https://github.com/hnvy/blog-1/commits):

* `Add E#XY to PROJECT_#_logs.md` (or `Add E#XY to PROJECT_#_pearls.md`): This means that a new session entry has been added (XY = session number) to `PROJECT_#_logs.md`/`PROJECT_#_pearls.md`. In a `pearls` file, this means that the pearls for the corresponding entry have been added.
* `Update FILENAME.md`: This means that I have corrected typos, added some minor details and so on.

## Template
This is the template which I will be using throughout the journey, however I may not use it for everything because it may not be practical!

Each entry (or day) will consist of:
* E#XY (XY = session number), date of entry (DD/MM/YYYY), and a title.
* General Thoughts (`GTs`).
* Time spent: # (where # is the number of minutes that passed since I started that particular session).
* Learning Points (`LPs`): things which I learned during that particular session.
* Learning Needs (`LNs`): things which I need to learn how to do by the next session.
* Action Plan (`AP`) {x DD/MM/YYYY}: a plan which would help me achieve my LNs. An "x" inside the {} means that this AP is now reviewed, and DD/MM/YYYY is the date of the review.
  * I'm using the [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm) method to create these APs. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time bound.
* `Review` of a previous AP: I need to pick and review a previous AP and state my new LPs (if I have accomplished it) OR LNs (if I have not accomplished it).
  * I will state the resources I used to achieve the AP.
  * If I did not manage to complete my AP due to whatever reason, I will either break it down into smaller APs or postpone it for later. Fear not, every AP will be reviewed.
