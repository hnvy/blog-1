* E#002 (25/07/2022) - CMD, find X in subdirectories.

Let's imagine that you are searching through a number of files for the string "~please find me~". There are 400 text files in 20 directories. You're unsure of which file that string belongs in.

What's the solution? Well, ~findstr~!

~findstr~ is a command that runs on CMD. Using ~findstr~ is very simple (you can run ~findstr /?~ to get the manual). My favourite arguments to run are:
- ~/s~: searches the subdirectories
- ~/i~: ignores sentence-case
- ~/c:~: allows ~findstr~ to search for a string that has white spaces

Suppose you have the following directory ~c:/Stats/Spreadsheets/~. Also, let's assume that the ~Spreadsheets~ folder has many files and many subfolders, and you're looking for the "~please find me~" string:
- ~findstr /s /i /c:"please find me" "c:/Stats/Spreadsheets/*"~ - This can be used if you aren't currently located in the directory.
- ~findstr /s /i /c:"please find me" *.*~ - this can be used if you are located in the directory.

* E#001 (16/07/2022) - RegEx, match lines to end of file.

In a text file, I recently had to replace something. Starting at a certain text (~PieceOfText~), up until the last line of the file. Here is how I went about it:
#+BEGIN_SRC
Find: PieceOfText((.|\n)*)
Replace: Blah blah blah
#+END_SRC

So, with the help of ~((.|\n)*)~, the following has been highlighted:
