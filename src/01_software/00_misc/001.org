* E#003 (2023-08-07) - GitHub, publish modified files only.
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgf169bb9
:END:

For the longest time, I have been trying to make GitHub Actions publish (to my website) the modified Org files only.

By that, I mean, if I edit ~001.org~, then I want Org-mode only publish this file, rather than re-publish the entire directory.

I have tried to use the timestamps feature which comes with Org-mode, but that did not work. Maybe it's because I have set it up incorrectly...

But anyway, finally, I have found the solution. Simply, save this as a ~.yml~ file under ~.github/workflows/~:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre><span class="variable-name">name</span>: Publish modified content to GitHub Pages

<span class="constant">on</span>:
  <span class="variable-name">push</span>:

</span>      <span class="comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="comment">This will allow us to publish the files to the correct folders (via ~xargs -I{} cp --parents {} ./copy/~).

</span>

      - <span class="variable-name">name</span>: Publish modified files only
        <span class="variable-name">run</span>: emacs -Q --script org-publish.el

      - <span class="variable-name">name</span>: Publish generated content to GitHub Pages branch

</span>          <span class="variable-name">commit-message</span>: Update ${{ github.sha }}
          <span class="variable-name">folder</span>: public
</pre>
#+END_EXPORT

Then, let it do the magic...

As can be seen, the ~Publish modified files only~ step is executing an Emacs script called ~org-publish.el~. The content of ~org-publish.el~ should be something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html

* E#002 (2022-07-25) - CMD, find X in subdirectories.
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgb07fb78
:END:

Let's imagine that you are searching through a number of files for the string "~please find me~". There are 400 text files in 20 directories. You're unsure of which file that string belongs in.

What's the solution? Well, ~findstr~!

~findstr~ is a command that runs on CMD. Using ~findstr~ is very simple (you can run ~findstr /?~ to get the manual). My favourite arguments to run are:
- ~/s~: searches the subdirectories
- ~/i~: ignores sentence-case
- ~/c:~: allows ~findstr~ to search for a string that has white spaces

Suppose you have the following directory ~c:/Stats/Spreadsheets/~. Also, let's assume that the ~Spreadsheets~ folder has many files and many subfolders, and you're looking for the "~please find me~" string:
- ~findstr /s /i /c:"please find me" "c:/Stats/Spreadsheets/*"~ - This can be used if you aren't currently located in the directory.
- ~findstr /s /i /c:"please find me" *.*~ - this can be used if you are located in the directory.

* E#001 (2022-07-16) - RegEx, match lines to end of file.

In a text file, I recently had to replace something. Starting at a certain text (~PieceOfText~), up until the last line of the file. Here is how I went about it:
#+BEGIN_SRC
Find: PieceOfText((.|\n)*)
Replace: Blah blah blah
#+END_SRC

So, with the help of ~((.|\n)*)~, the following has been highlighted:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
