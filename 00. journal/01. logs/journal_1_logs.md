# Introduction
This is where I'll put my ideas or thoughts. I've adapted some of them from other sources (all of which will be credited and referenced). Others, as far as I'm aware, are unique. If I later discover that a concept has already been proposed elsewhere, I shall reference it.

# E#1 (08/08/2021) - daily proportion (idea)
Have you ever had the problem of not being able to see which tasks take up most of your time? Here's a suggestion based on the Pomodoro approach that I picked up and developed.

1. Create a table with two columns: `Task category` and `Time spent`.
2. Track the time spend on each of the tasks you do/plan to do throughout your day.
3. At the end of the day, put these tasks into categories.
4. Add up the time taken per category, and record it under `Time spent`.
5. Using Excel/Google spreadsheets, create a bar chart of all of the categories.
6. Save your spreadsheet.
7. Repeat the next day. Over time, you will end up with a enough data to get meaningful results.

Take a look at the graphs below.

You can see that, on this particular day,Â category "F" took the longest time:

Here is a different set of data:

This chart was created using the information gathered previously. We can now observe that category "B" has occupied the majority of the time during the last three days:
