# Introduction
This is where I'll put my ideas or thoughts. I've adapted some of them from other sources (all of which will be credited and referenced). Others, as far as I'm aware, are unique. If I later discover that a concept has already been proposed elsewhere, I shall reference it.

Please keep in mind that these ideas and thoughts are based on my personal experiences. Don't expect something I've written to suit you if you decide to implement it into your personal life.

- I = idea
- T-I = thought/idea

# E#4 (28/02/2022) - no template, no problem (T)
I've had to rethink how I operate things as a result of the neglect of this so-called blog. It all began in a rather regular and upbeat manner. But, over time, I began to disregard it. Why? Well, after a few moments of contemplation, I've come up with the answer: I've created too many limiting self-imposed templates and pieces of guidance (which, don't get me wrong, may come in handy at some point in the future. Just not now, especially not when this whole thing is nothing but a baby project) that I've held myself accountable to before even gaining a sense of what this venture is all about, which is unrestrained learning. I was learning someplace I didn't have to think too hard or be worried of being judged for the messiness of it all by someone (i.e., my overthinking and overcomplicating self).

I went through this unnecessary tension before every commitment. The anxiety and concern that I had made a mistake, whether it was an intellectual or a spelling/grammar one. All of this occurred without my realising that mistakes are perfectly acceptable. I think that mistakes, not perfectionism, is a better way for us to learn.

Anyway, let this serve as a reminder to myself. There will be no more overcomplicating things. This is supposed to be a place where I can share what I've learned and experienced, not a place where I can appease my critical self.

There will be no more onerous templates to follow from now on. It's just me passing along pearls of information.

# E#3 (10/09/2021) - a free mind is a creative mind (T)
I was asked the other day about what sort of activities do I do when I listen to a podcast. Here was my response:
> I wander around the room while listening to the podcast. It's not the same as going for a walk outside. I tend to recall more information that way, which may sound strange. Not only that, but I like to use walking and cleaning as a way to disconnect from technology. While cleaning, I've solved innumerable dilemmas and come up with countless ideas. I don't want to miss out on this opportunity. If I listen to a podcast during cleaning, I fail to achieve the same effect.

More often than I initially thought, I will come up with ideas when I am away from the task. It is as if my brain is doing some thinking in the background without me realising, linking previous and current knowledge together to formulate new knowledge. Which, I personally think, is fascinating.

Here is my current process:
- Work on a task until I am unable to solve the issue/bored.
- Clean my room/dishes/feed the dog/play with the cat/tidy the yard and so on.
- New idea pops into my head.
- I continue working on the current task (e.g., cleaning) until done.

The most important thing I realised was that I needed to do these activities not with the goal of addressing the problem, but rather to complete them. If I'm stuck on problem X, for example, I should clean my room with the purpose of truly cleaning it (and not solving the problem). Also, I must not force myself to come up with ideas. It should happen naturally and with ease.

I have really underappreciated the importance of a break. From now on, I will try to make this a habit.

In psychology, this is called an "*incubation period*."

Why am I not interested in listening to a podcast during this time off? Listening to some of my podcasts needs intentional mental effort (they are dense in information). I must evaluate and comprehend what the host is saying. While some people may find this to be a useful distraction, I find it to be unappealing (i.e., I haven't been able to generate any ideas using this method). I'd need to experience a moment of tranquility for the ideas to start coming through. I like to get up and move around; let my mind wander. It is, however, on my to-do list. I plan to find some light and entertaining podcasts that are not cognitively demanding. Who knows, maybe I will benefit from this experience.

I plan to write more about this subject in the future, but for now, I'll sign off.

# E#2 (09/08/2021) - graphical view of your day (I)
I'll be honest with you: I'm not a big fan of traditional daily TODO lists. They can be rather intimidating at times, especially if I let them build up over time. I've tried a lot of TODO list applications, but none of them alleviated this feeling.

I recently realised that if I could 'gamify' (or visually express) my daily TODO list so that it no longer feels overwhelming, I would finally be able to complete tasks.

Take a look at the illustration below. A category/task is represented by a coloured block. The timestamps indicate hour at which you should switch tasks. Looking at it now, it doesn't seem so frightening because all I have to do is keep up with the black triangle and everything will be alright.

I know that there are apps out there which utilise pie/donut charts, but I personally find a bar chart more suitable for this.

Why? Well, to begin with, it is easier for me to read than a round donut chart. Secondly, it provides a more straightforward comparison of relative time spent on each task. I can easily see that the dark blue task takes more time than the amber one.

# E#1 (08/08/2021) - daily proportion (I)
Have you ever had the problem of not being able to see which tasks take up most of your time? Here's a suggestion based on the Pomodoro approach that I picked up and developed.

1. Create a table with two columns: `Task category` and `Time spent`.
2. Track the time spend on each of the tasks you do/plan to do throughout your day.
3. At the end of the day, put these tasks into categories.
4. Add up the time taken per category, and record it under `Time spent`.
5. Using Excel/Google spreadsheets, create a bar chart of all of the categories.
6. Save your spreadsheet.
7. Repeat the next day. Over time, you will end up with a enough data to get meaningful results.

Take a look at the graphs below.

You can see that, on this particular day,Â category "F" took the longest time:

Here is a different set of data:

This chart was created using the information gathered previously. We can now observe that category "B" has occupied the majority of the time during the last three days:
