# Introduction
This is where I'll put my ideas or thoughts. I've adapted some of them from other sources (all of which will be credited and referenced). Others, as far as I'm aware, are unique. If I later discover that a concept has already been proposed elsewhere, I shall reference it.

Please keep in mind that these ideas and thoughts are based on my personal experiences. Don't expect something I've written to suit you if you decide to implement it into your personal life.

# E#2 (09/08/2021) - graphical view of your day (idea)
I'll be honest with you: I'm not a big fan of traditional daily TODO lists. They can be rather intimidating at times, especially if I let them build up over time. I've tried a lot of TODO list applications, but none of them alleviated this feeling.

I recently realised that if I could 'gamify' (or visually express) my daily TODO list so that it no longer feels overwhelming, I would finally be able to complete tasks.

Take a look at the illustration below. A category/task is represented by a coloured block. The timestamps indicate hour at which you should switch tasks. Looking at it now, it doesn't seem so frightening because all I have to do is keep up with the black triangle and everything will be alright.

I know that there are apps out there which utilise pie/donut charts, but I personally find a bar chart more suitable for this.

Why? Well, to begin with, it is easier for me to read than a round donut chart. Secondly, it provides a more straightforward comparison of relative time spent on each task. I can easily see that the dark blue task takes more time than the amber one.

# E#1 (08/08/2021) - daily proportion (idea)
Have you ever had the problem of not being able to see which tasks take up most of your time? Here's a suggestion based on the Pomodoro approach that I picked up and developed.

1. Create a table with two columns: `Task category` and `Time spent`.
2. Track the time spend on each of the tasks you do/plan to do throughout your day.
3. At the end of the day, put these tasks into categories.
4. Add up the time taken per category, and record it under `Time spent`.
5. Using Excel/Google spreadsheets, create a bar chart of all of the categories.
6. Save your spreadsheet.
7. Repeat the next day. Over time, you will end up with a enough data to get meaningful results.

Take a look at the graphs below.

You can see that, on this particular day,Â category "F" took the longest time:

Here is a different set of data:

This chart was created using the information gathered previously. We can now observe that category "B" has occupied the majority of the time during the last three days:
