<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Software is completely error-free. Error is not an option. Please note that I am not talking about bugs. There are bugs because of human error (the human coded something incorrectly, and hence caused the software to break in some way).
</p>

<p>
Literally, a software is a set of instructions that the computer must obey. Therefore, if you tell it to do <code>ABC</code>, it will do <code>ABC</code>. The program will print the word "Hello" when you instruct it to do so. Nothing more or less. The words "wow," "lol," or "good morning" won't be printed. Just "Hello".
</p>

<p>
So, could we perhaps stop blaming machines for mistakes?
</p>

<p>
Yes, occasionally anything might go wrong. However, a computer is unlikely to blame for this (unless it had to do with a hardware issue. Even so, the human should have upgraded the computer, so it's not really its fault).
</p>

<p>
The reason for this entry's idea is because I frequently hear comments like "never trust referencing software since it gets the referencing style wrong" and "reference everything by hand." This is the furthest thing from the truth. Simply put, the reference programe does nothing more than stylize the data you have entered into the field.
</p>

<p>
It is quite likely that <b>you</b>, not the software, are to blame if something went wrong with the referencing. So make sure you read some of the documentation before you start pointing the finger at the program.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8016f98">
<p>
For a time now, I've been considering posting a story on this website. I was reluctant to do so primarily due to my concern for other people's opinions. But, everyone has to start someplace. Others choose to write publicly, while some prefer to write more discreetly and privately.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, the journey will be intriguing. I have quite a few ideas in mind.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org88cb90e">
<p>
Imagine a website where you could post your helpful code snippets for everyone to use. Just development and learning, no bloat, no fluff, no filler content. Literally, just useful code snippets.
</p>

<p>
I want this website to be like Stack Overflow, but instead of people asking questions, they would just upload their tiny pieces of code in different programming languages. Recipes with a variety of functions. Additionally, they could give examples of how this helped them.
</p>

<p>
I mention this because I have been engaging in similar behaviour. I've been using different bits and pieces of code from different projects (see <a href="https://hnvy.github.io/html/about.html">About</a>). Personally, I found it to be quite helpful.
</p>

<p>
Of course, there should be certain regulations for this:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The snippet must be by annotated so that everyone can understand it and make good use of it</li>
<li>The code should be broad enough to be employed in multiple contexts</li>
<li>The developer could include some examples of how/when to utilise the code snippet they shared</li>
</ul>

<p>
I might attempt this. It is still a good idea to post for everyone to see even though I am not well-known enough to get volunteers to offer their expertise. Who knows, perhaps a well-known programmer can take this simple concept and turn it into something big.
</p>

<p>
It will function similarly to GitHub Gist, but as a hub as opposed to being dispersed everywhere.

<h2 id="orgee07f40">E#012 (01/07/2022) - perseverance and tasks (T)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgee07f40">
<p>
Incremental change of your behaviour is fantastic method to manage your current habits and continue. Small achievable dollops of targets are set before your eyes. But, the biggest issue is that a perseverance test is only undertaken when you reach a plateau line, which you may not have expected. Also, a lot of (mental and/or physical) effort is required for someone to induce this change.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at an example to explain the above.
</p>

<p>
I used to adore going to the gym; I began to make progress and build strength, but after a little while, my progress seemed to have stifled! It felt as though I hit a brick wall, and I had no idea that something like this was intended to occur.
</p>

<p>
If we use water as an example (I apologise, but water is a terrific way to convey this idea. Please do bear with me).
</p>

<p>
Water has 3 states, right? Solid, liquid, and gas.
</p>

<p>
Let's say that we start off in the solid form, which is getting heated; as a result, our entropy, which literally translates to "disorder" in physical chemistry, increases. As the entropy increases, the water molecules begin to break free from this organised framework (i.e., they will begin to move away from the solid state, and turn to liquid). This describes the negligible improvement I have made with my body and is comparable to the gym narrative above.
</p>

<p>
So let's keep heating our water till it becomes liquid. Just as before, once this liquid is heated, it continues to destabilise (until it begins turning into gas, which represents the maximum point of disorder). The issue is that turning water from solid to liquid requires MUCH LESS energy than turning it from liquid to gas. This is an illustration of a fitness plateau I experienced, where, even though I had already experienced some progress, I have to put in a lot more time and work before I could start making new improvements.
</p>

<p>
What is the point of the above example?
</p>

<p>
Well, it had occurred to me that a lot of people give up far too soon. That could happen for a variety of reasons, many of which I have not yet identified.
</p>

<p>
Let this serve as a reminder to myself to persevere because, after a plateau, progress might occur.

<h2 id="org1a85822">E#011 (26/06/2022) - catching thoughts with reflection (T+I)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1a85822">
<p>
Your brain is like a fruit and vegetable-bearing tree. New ones are always being created, whether seasonally or throughout the year.
</p>

<p>
That tree's fruits and vegetables are your thoughts and ideas. The tree is the source of these.
</p>

<p>
When the fruit is fully developed and mature, it falls from the tree and rolls to the ground. Until it is either devoured by a rat or rots to the point of no longer being discernible.
</p>

<p>
The same is true of your brain, which contains hundreds of thousands of subconcious and transitory thoughts. Almost all of the time, you are completely unaware of it while you go about your daily routine. You are completely oblivious of the vast array of possibilities that would have opened up if you had caught all of those thoughts.
</p>

<p>
However, your external environment requires far too much of you. Because you're continuously distracted, these potentially strong thoughts aren't properly registered by oneself, and they fade away over time.
</p>

<p>
What is the solution?
</p>

<p>
Consider yourself a farmer who wants to harvest the fruits and veggies of this incredibly fruitful tree. What is the best course of action? A basket!
</p>

<p>
But how does that relate to thought-catching? The answer, as you might have suspected, is reflection.
</p>

<p>
In this circumstance, the basket is reflection. It's a tool that people can use to capture ephemeral thoughts that aren't usually logged by your brain.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7a7dcd7">
<p>
Now, I'm going to make a promise to you. In no way, shape, or form is what follows a pseudoscience report. It's just something that has been happening to me for a long time. It's most likely just a coincidence with no significance, but I thought it would be a shame to not share it. After all, this is a learning journey. This is, after all, a learning experience.
</p>

<p>
My left ear becomes red whenever I think about something that requires reasoning and problem solving. My right ear turns red everytime I try to recall a specific fact (without solving a problem).
</p>

<p>
I asked three friends to pay close attention to this and report back to me on their findings. Two of them got the same outcome as mine. The other, on the other hand, was the polar opposite. Yes, I know, the sample size couldn't possibly be any smaller!
</p>

<p>
The left and right hand brain distribution (2 of my pals were left-handed, and the third was right-handed) was the first thing that came to mind. The right-handed friend and the left-handed got the same result as me, whereas the other left-handed friend got the opposite result. Perhaps I need to learn more about this topic to gain a better understanding of it.
</p>

<p>
Potential topics to learn about:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Brain dominance functional variations</li>
<li>Brain blood supply</li>
<li>Handedness</li>

<h2 id="orga3943e2">E#009 (27/05/2022) - non-receptive (T)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga3943e2">
<p>
I've begun to realise that my classmates are not at all receptive. By "receptive," I mean they don't share the same passion as their colleagues and don't listen to their fears, venting, or anxiety.
</p>

<p>
This could be hazardous to the individual who is expressing their problems. It irritates me, and gives me a great deal of anguish and aggravation, when I don't get a response from the individual I'm speaking with (especially when the issue I'm discussing affects both of us equally or impacts them far more than it does me).
</p>

<p>
I had the impression that maybe, just maybe, they are Stoics without realising it. But no, they are unconcerned. How can you be unconcerned if something goes wrong with you? How could you refuse to try to educate someone who has wronged you? Why would you not strive for change?
</p>

<p>
If you don't care, and I don't care, and the person next to you doesn't care, we'll wind up in a world where nobody gives a flying elephant about anything. This, in my opinion, will only stifle development and progress.
</p>

<p>
We should not be concerned with things that are beyond our control, according to Stoicism (and various other schools of thought). That is something with which I completely agree. However, all of the issues that bother me are ones over which we could possibly have complete control over.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following scenario: your workplace implements a new proposal that the majority of your coworkers oppose. You have the power to raise this issue with your manager/supervisor in a meeting. Would you go through with it? You would, of course! If your suggestion is rejected by your manager/supervisor, you should inquire about bringing the matter to your coworkers' attention, where they could voice their opinions through a vote or other means. If your second suggestion is rejected, you will begin to consider the possibility that something is beyond your control. But even then, that should not stop you from trying to change things.
</p>

<p>
Rejecting both of your suggestions is the worst case scenario. What is the best case scenario? Your manager will take your suggestions into consideration and act on them (imagine how happy you would be when that happens).
</p>

<p>
Stoicism can be misinterpreted as giving up the moment you sense that something is out of your reach. This, in my opinion, is a major misunderstanding. Yes, you can tell when something is under your control and when it isn't (e.g., the behaviour of others is quite outside of your control whereas your thoughts and actions are totally within). However, in the circumstance I just described, we have no idea unless we give it a go.
</p>

<p>
Beware, however. Do not confuse "moaning" (which is simply venting without the attempt to bring about a change) with what I have said above. Be a human of action.
</p>

<p>
Observing this phenomenon is extremely heartbreaking. There could be a variety of personal reasons for this, including but not limited to fear of repercussions and penalties.

<h2 id="org73993f1">E#008 (26/04/2022) - not on my syllabus (T)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org73993f1">
<p>
It started to become not uncommon to witness colleagues from medical school completely shut down their eyes, ears, and brains when they hear, from a professor, that the topic we're currently being taught will not be examined. This is despite the fact that some of those colleagues find these certain topics interesting.
</p>

<p>
I find that such approach generates quite a few issues. Below, I will outline some of the ones that came to mind. I will probably add more in the future.
</p>

<p>
Instead of using curriculum as a map to direct your journey, use it as a flashlight to see where you should be going. The curriculum, like a torch, has a shortsightedness to it. It frequently fails to anticipate or accurately reflect the future. Allow your hunger for knowledge to serve as the map that leads you across the cosmos.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind, however, that this does not apply to all curricula. Some curricula are quite broad and allow for a certain degree of self-exploration and discovery, which is great. Those type of curricula are able to weed out students which are not interested in the subject. Other curricula, on the other hand, are extremely specific. To make matters worse, you'll be labelled a "failure" if you don't follow this ultra-specific curriculum.
</p>

<p>
The curriculum isn't the same as actual life. There are numerous vital topics that are not covered in the curriculum (and mainly this is because there is little time). You can only be limited by your curriculum if you rely on it too much. Those who let the curriculum determine what they should and shouldn't learn are expected to encounter numerous challenges in the future, as no one will tell them what to learn once they graduate.
</p>

<p>
I don't hold it against those students. To some extent, I agree with them: students should devote more time to studying the topics that will be assessed, otherwise they will fail the exams. At the same time, they should not fully block out all non-examineable information. This, in my opinion, is not the best way to nurture learning. Medical school is only the beginning of a career in Medicine. Medicine is a voyage that will last a lifetime. You, my friend, are well on your way to becoming a one-of-a-kind doctor if you can harness this ability, early on, to discover useful content and learn it despite the fact that it is not mandated by the curriculum.

<h2 id="org8d2b587">E#007 (12/04/2022) - reflect on it (T+I)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8d2b587">
<p>
I've seen students try to 'optimise' their lifestyle by using a variety of 'productivity' applications and tools far too many times to count. These apps can sometimes be useful. Sometimes yes, and sometimes no. Not in the least.
</p>

<p>
And, in order to tackle this problem, the students fail to consider that maybe, just maybe, using a lot of apps isn't the answer to their productivity concerns. Rather, they add to their failed arsenal more of the latest apps and updates.
</p>

<p>
It's similar to how you lose the flavour of chewing gum after a while. So, what exactly do you do? Spit it out and replace it with a fresh one? OR add a new gum to the already stale one in your mouth?
</p>

<p>
To some, the solution to the above conundrum is to replace it. Which, in my opinion, is a far superior option. What do you suppose would happen if you keep adding a new gum every time you lose the taste, without getting rid of the globuar mass that has formed inside your cubbyhole?
</p>

<p>
Apps for productivity can be used in the same way. A productivity app rarely aids in the completion of a task. All of these bright colours and sophisticated typefaces are just a diversion from your main objective. You spend countless hours researching and customising your new apps, only to have them fail tragically. Instead of pausing to reflect on what has just occurred, you continue to download new ones!
</p>

<p>
Reflection is the answer. Assume you have a task that you despise. Or a task you've been putting off for far too long. What would you do in this situation?
</p>

<p>
So you go to Google and type in your problem, and you get a cliche response like "use a to-do list," "the savvy entrepreneur employed the pomodoro technique," "this well-established business woman has four distinct calendars," and so on. It's a headache to read, and it's occasionally ludicrous.
</p>

<p>
Don't get me wrong: I've been caught in that trap several times. Until I've had my fill. Because none of the 'productivity' applications helped me be more productive, I quit using them altogether. They give me the impression that I am being productive, but it's merely a psychological effect.
</p>

<p>
As I have said, reflection is the answer. But what would you reflect about? I usually reflect about two things: do I need to do this task? If so, what would I get out of it?
</p>

<p>
But wait, there's more. You aren't going to give a half-hearted response. No. Instead, you should jot it down (preferably with a pen and paper rather than a computer). Why? Because writing it down compels you to <b>really</b> consider and analyse it. You are forcing your brain to only focus on one thing, and one thing only: reflection.
</p>

<p>
You will notice that once you've written a paragraph or two about why you should be doing that task, you would have fully convinced yourself to actually begin doing the task. It is then, and only then, do you cease that golden opportunity.
</p>

<p>
"Great, however after 40 minutes, my motivation begins to wane. So, what do I do now?" You go through the same steps as before. Perhaps you will realise that you should be working on something else this time. Perhaps this new task is more important.
</p>

<p>
The task's genuine nature is only revealed via reflection. Without reflection, the task is akin to seeing a huge, eerie shadow on your bedroom wall. Upon closer examination, you see that the gigantic shadow is cast by nothing more than a 2 cm toy&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Here are the steps summarised:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Look at your to-do list</li>
<li>Pick a task</li>
<li>Grab a pen and a piece of paper</li>
<li>Write a couple of paragraphs (or rough notes, doodles. Whatever floats your boat) about whether you <b>need</b> to do this task? And if yes, what would you get out of it?</li>
<li>Start working on that task once you are motivated</li>
<li>If you are not motivated, then repeat steps 1-5 again.</li>
</ol>

<p>
That is all. A simple life is what you need, not a new app.

For a long, long time, I was fascinated by art (probably at around the age of 5 or 6). It amazes me that you can bring your imagination to life and share it with others.
</p>

<p>
But the problem was that I never had the opportunity to understand it thoroughly. I've only recently begun learning it, and it's a lot of fun. It is, in fact, arguably the first and only activity that can properly divert my attention away from my other issues. Up the art!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3d1bfdb">
<p>
I've had to rethink how I operate things as a result of the neglect of this so-called blog. It all began in a rather regular and upbeat manner. But, over time, I began to disregard it. Why? Well, after a few moments of contemplation, I've come up with the answer: I've created too many limiting self-imposed templates and pieces of guidance (which, don't get me wrong, may come in handy at some point in the future. Just not now, especially not when this whole thing is nothing but a baby project) that I've held myself accountable to before even gaining a sense of what this venture is all about, which is unrestrained learning. It was someplace where I could learn and not have to think too hard or be worried of being judged for the messiness of it all by someone (i.e., my overthinking and overcomplicating self).
</p>

<p>
I went through this unnecessary tension before every commitment. The anxiety and concern that I had made a mistake, whether it was an intellectual or a spelling/grammar one. All of this occurred without my realising that mistakes are perfectly acceptable. I think that mistakes, not perfectionism, is a better way for us to learn.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, let this serve as a reminder to myself. There will be no more overcomplicating things. This is supposed to be a place where I can share what I've learned and experienced, not a place where I can appease my critical self.
</p>

<p>
There will be no more onerous templates to follow from now on. It's just me passing along pearls of information.

<p>
I was asked the other day about what sort of activities do I do when I listen to a podcast. Here was my response:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>I wander around the room while listening to the podcast. It's not the same as going for a walk outside. I tend to recall more information that way, which may sound strange. Not only that, but I like to use walking and cleaning as a way to disconnect from technology. While cleaning, I've solved innumerable dilemmas and come up with countless ideas. I don't want to miss out on this opportunity. If I listen to a podcast during cleaning, I fail to achieve the same effect.</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
More often than I initially thought, I will come up with ideas when I am away from the task. It is as if my brain is doing some thinking in the background without me realising, linking previous and current knowledge together to formulate new knowledge. Which, I personally think, is fascinating.
</p>

<p>
Here is my current process:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Work on a task until I am unable to solve the issue/bored.</li>
<li>Clean my room/dishes/feed the dog/play with the cat/tidy the yard and so on.</li>
<li>New idea pops into my head.</li>
<li>I continue working on the current task (e.g., cleaning) until done.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The most important thing I realised was that I needed to do these activities not with the goal of addressing the problem, but rather to complete them. If I'm stuck on problem X, for example, I should clean my room with the purpose of truly cleaning it (and not solving the problem). Also, I must not force myself to come up with ideas. It should happen naturally and with ease.
</p>

<p>
I have really underappreciated the importance of a break. From now on, I will try to make this a habit.
</p>

<p>
In psychology, this is called an "<b>incubation period</b>."
</p>

<p>
Why am I not interested in listening to a podcast during this time off? Listening to some of my podcasts needs intentional mental effort (they are dense in information). I must evaluate and comprehend what the host is saying. While some people may find this to be a useful distraction, I find it to be unappealing (i.e., I haven't been able to generate any ideas using this method). I'd need to experience a moment of tranquility for the ideas to start coming through. I like to get up and move around; let my mind wander. It is, however, on my to-do list. I plan to find some light and entertaining podcasts that are not cognitively demanding. Who knows, maybe I will benefit from this experience.
</p>

<p>
I plan to write more about this subject in the future, but for now, I'll sign off.

Take a look at this <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1sYXB5n3Q86dGG4HLeMAzOT4zYaRwDTaT">illustration</a>. A category/task is represented by a coloured block. The timestamps indicate hour at which you should switch tasks. Looking at it now, it doesn't seem so frightening because all I have to do is keep up with the black triangle and everything will be alright.

I know that there are apps out there which utilise pie/donut charts, but I personally find a bar chart more suitable for this.
</p>

<p>
Why? Well, to begin with, it is easier for me to read than a round donut chart. Secondly, it provides a more straightforward comparison of relative time spent on each task. I can easily see that the dark blue task takes more time than the amber one.

Have you ever had the problem of not being able to see which tasks take up most of your time? Here's a suggestion based on the Pomodoro approach that I picked up and developed.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a table with two columns: <code>Task category</code> and <code>Time spent</code>.</li>
<li>Track the time spend on each of the tasks you do/plan to do throughout your day.</li>
<li>At the end of the day, put these tasks into categories.</li>
<li>Add up the time taken per category, and record it under <code>Time spent</code>.</li>
<li>Using Excel/Google spreadsheets, create a bar chart of all of the categories.</li>
<li>Save your spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Repeat the next day. Over time, you will end up with a enough data to get meaningful results.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Take a look at the graphs below.

<p>
In this <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1e_DRuKaEHvn9x-Bh19zY7SY6y3EiVogB">figure</a>, you can see that, on that particular day, category "F" took the longest time.

</p>

<p>
This <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-oQJSYm0f5pbOt4eflNpQ6GP1PE8-otj">chart</a> was created using the information gathered previously. We can now observe that category "B" has occupied the majority of the time during the last three days.
