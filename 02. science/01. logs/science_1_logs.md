# Introduction
Here I'll discuss various non-computer science topics that I find fascinating. Please do your research after reading the content before memorising it, as there is no assurance that it will be accurate, correct, or up-to-date. If you see an error, or if you want to discuss something, then please let me know. I'll be more than happy to chat about geeky things!

I have decided to post my science notes (mainly Medicine-related) online for people to have a look at (particularly other healthcare professionals). They may be inaccurate, and indeed wrong at times. Yet again, I strongly advise that you should ALWAYS refer back to a credible source before commiting this knowledge to memory.

The text will be difficult to understand at times, and that is because I don't quite have the time to simplify it. However, I have tried my best to make it super easy to understand (even by a curious 9-year-old)!

If a topic is large enough, I may make a separate file that is dedicated to it. The file will most likely be written in stages rather than all at once.

Finally, you'll note that I've included some of my own artwork. This is because I believe that science is art and art is science. I'll most likely write about it in the future.

# E#2 (26/03/2022) - the last shroom heading to its doom
According to a legend, this is the final mushroom on the planet. And now it is being taken to the final door by a wanderer. The door that will determine whether it will be utilised as a simple ingredient in a potion to save the prince or whether it will be nurtured and grown. We'll never find out...

# E#1 (25/03/2022) - fries, flies, and brain pies
A blue alien is salivating because the platter in front of it - which contains three fries, a fly, and a brain pie - looks splendid. This is the first time I've ever used digital media to create a piece of art. It was quite a lot of fun.
