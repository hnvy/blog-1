<p>
Here is how to create an interactive table of contents (well, sort of) in a plain text file.
</p>

<p>
Your text file must first have some kind of structure that outlines headings. Even though it is not necessary, this step will undoubtedly make your life much simpler.
</p>

<p>
So, let's say we have the following format:
</p>

<pre><code>
# Heading 1
## Subheading 1.1
## Subheading 1.2
## Subheading 1.3
# Heading 2
# Heading 3
## Subheading 3.1
</code></pre>

<p>
&#x2026; and you wish to rapidly traverse that file using a table of contents of some kind. What you need to have is as follows (there is really just one thing):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>sha256</code>: According to Wikipedia, <code>sha256</code> is a "cryptographic hash functions." In other words, it is a function which encodes the text you give it. In fact, you don't even need to use <code>sha256</code>. You can using any algorithm which encodes your text. You can even make your own! But, why go through all the trouble of creating your own algorithm when you can use Notepad++ or Vim (as they have this as a built-in feature)?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since this is the Vim logs (<code>vim_1_logs.md</code>) file, here is how you would go about it in Vim:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Press <code>:</code></li>
<li>Type the following: <code>let @"=sha256('____')</code> (replace the <code>____</code> with whatever text you want. In this case, the text will be our headings).</li>
<li>The command above has now made the <code>"</code> register in Vim equal to the <code>sha256</code> of our text. So, if you press <code>p</code>, Vim will paste the content of the <code>"</code> register into your text file. So, to encode <code>Heading 1</code>, we will have to write the following <code>let @"=sha256('# Heading 1')</code>. The content of the <code>"</code> register will now be: <code>bbc42...e1f03</code> (this is known as the "hash"). We can use this unique identifier to create our table of contents.</li>
<li>Place your cursor at the beginning of the line which has <code># Heading 1</code>, and press <code>P</code>. This will paste the hash right before <code># Heading 1</code>. So, you should have something like this <code>bbc42...e1f03# Heading 1</code> (I know, it looks quite ugly).</li>
<li>Now, press <code>yy</code> to yank (or copy) the line.</li>
<li>Press <code>gg</code> to go back to the start of the text file, and create a heading with a name like <code># Table of Contents</code>.</li>
<li>Press <code>p</code> to paste the line that we have yanked in the previous step. So, you should end up with something like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>
# Table of Contents
bbc42...e1f03# Heading 1
</code></pre>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What we have done is, effectively, create some visible 'link' between the Table of Contents heading and the actual heading in the text file. Again, it looks ugly, but at least it works.</li>
<li>Repeat the steps above for the rest of your headings, or, you can use the following macro: <code>nmap &lt;M-0&gt; ^v$hy:let @"=sha256('&lt;C-r&gt;"')&lt;CR&gt;Pyygg</code> (this maps the steps 1-6 to <code>Alt-0</code>. You can then go down and paste the content using <code>p</code>. Also, to ensure that the mapping is wiped and that it does not affect you in the future, execute <code>unmap &lt;M-0&gt;</code> after you're done).</li>
<li>The end result should be something like this (To use the 'navigation feature', you can place your cursor on the hash that is under the Table of Contents, and press <code>#</code>. This will take you straight to the desired heading.):</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>
# Table of Contents
bbc42...e1f03# Heading 1
37ce0...bfc1c## Subheading 1.1
96620...01a72## Subheading 1.2
a8a5e...93789## Subheading 1.3
1cb48...e0efi# Heading 2
4ee32...6a839# Heading 3
b1e43...9698f## Subheading 3.1




bbc42...e1f03# Heading 1
Here is some text

37ce0...bfc1c## Subheading 1.1
Some more text!

96620...01a72## Subheading 1.2
Blah blah blah blah...

a8a5e...93789## Subheading 1.3
Running out of text ideas :\

1cb48...e0efi# Heading 2
Maybe I should have used a Lorem Ipsum generator or something...

Second paragraph.

4ee32...6a839# Heading 3
Or maybe, I should have used less headings:
- Reminder
- For
- Me

b1e43...9698f## Subheading 3.1
Anyway, I'm glad that this is done now.

<p>
I've been wondering if I can use Vim to look up a highlighted word/sentence that is in the current buffer. Perhaps, a way that is more practical than:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Copy the thing which you want to search up on the internet</li>
<li>Open the browser</li>
<li>Paste it in the search bar of your browser</li>
<li>Press <code>Enter</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
And, to my surprise, there was! Here is what you need to add to your <code>vimrc</code>:
</p>

<p>
<code>vmap &lt;C-3&gt; "zy:let @z = substitute(@z,' ','+','g')&lt;CR&gt;:exec ":silent ! start https://www.google.com/search?q=". @z. ""&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;</code>
</p>

<p>
So, this is how it works:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Go into Visual mode by pressing <code>v</code>, and highlight the words of interest</li>
<li>Press <code>Ctrl+3</code> (by modifying the <code>&lt;C-3&gt;</code> in the line of code above, you can make this keyboard shortcut to whatever you want)</li>
<li>That's it! Isn't that so convenient?!</li>
</ol>

<p>
This was originally something I found online, but for some reason the web answer did not work. So I tweaked the code a bit and it worked. In any case, here's the link to the original answer: <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_the_web_for_text_selected_in_Vim">https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_the_web_for_text_selected_in_Vim</a>.
