# Introduction
Here I will document my language learning progress. I plan to learn the following languages (in order of priority):
1. Japanese (I'd like to read a few of my favourite Japanese books in their original language)
2. Arabic (I think this has the most complex syntax of any language, and knowing a significant portion of it would be terrific)
3. Russian (same as reason as Japanese)

On and off, I've attempted to learn Japanese. I began on the 2nd of July, 2019. When university commenced, though, I had little to no time to devote to language learning, and therefore I put it on pause.

On the 26th of August, 2020, I attempted to restart. The same problem as before has arisen, and I've put it on hold once more.

After some thought, I believe the lack of a comprehensive timeline and roadmap was to blame. It was a disaster to not have either of those. It's going to be different this time. Every weekend, I will commit a couple of hours to learning a language. Slowly but steadily, I am improving at this skill. Take a look at the number of [art pieces](/02.%20science/01.%20logs/science_1_logs.md) I've created, for example (I know it is not much, but at least it is not zero!).

When it comes to learning a language, spaced repetition is crucial. Integrating yourself in it is just as, if not more, beneficial. So, these are the only two tool which I will use in order to learn new languages. No paid apps, and certainly no fancy software!

# E#2 (29/05/2022) - numbers (J)

I learned the numbers today.

- いち - 1
- に - 2
- さん - 3
- し/よん - 4
- ご - 5
- ろく - 6
- なな/しち - 7
- はち - 8
- く/きゅう - 9
- じゅう - 10

In order to say numbers such as 11, 12, 13, etc. you the number 10 first and then add a single digit number. Like so:
- じゅういち - 11
- じゅうに - 12

You can remember it this way: you take the number 10, and add to it. So, 10 (じゅう) + 1 (いち) = 11 (じゅういち). If you remember this one, then you can just do the opposite for the next part!

In order to say numbers such as 20, 30, 40, etc. you say a single digit number first, and then the number 10. Like so:
- にじゅう - 20
- さんじゅう - 30

# E#1 (16/05/2022) - scripts (J)

So, just to give you some background, I've already memorised the Hiragana and Katakana scripts (in 2019). But I wanted a refresher, so I went over them again this week!

Also, I already know that the Japanese language is made up of the three scripts: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji.

Hiragana and Katakana are the equivalent of letters. Kanji is a little more complex.
