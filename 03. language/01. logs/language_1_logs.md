# Introduction
Here I will document my language learning progress. I plan to learn the following languages (in order of priority):
1. Japanese
2. Arabic
3. Russian

On and off, I've attempted to learn Japanese. I began on the 2nd of July, 2019. When university commenced, though, I had little to no time to devote to language learning, and therefore I put it on pause.

On the 26th of August, 2020, I attempted to restart. The same problem as before has arisen, and I've put it on hold once more.

After some thought, I believe the lack of a comprehensive timeline and roadmap was to blame. It was a disaster to not have either of those. It's going to be different this time. Every weekend, I will commit a couple of hours to learning a language. Slowly but steadily, I am improving at this skill. Take a look at the number of [art pieces](./02.%20science/01.%20logs/science_1_logs.md) I've created, for example (I know it is not much, but at least it is not zero!).
